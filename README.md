  * Define the project: (See the slides)
  * Context/Background
  * Tentative Schedule
  * Task: Come up with a quick question regarding stem salaries and use the data to create some visualizations to answer your questions.
* Week 2: EDA & Data Cleaning
  * Form groups and teams:
  * Get to know each other
  * Brainstorm research questions
  * Perform EDA to answer research questions.
  * Note: Your research questions should be able to be broken down into smaller pieces so that thereâ€™s much more content to work on instead of answering it with one plot.
  * You can find different variations of the same questions. E.g. If you are investigating the change of salary throughout the years, you could dissect it by location, company, race, gender, or other categorical variable.
* Week 3: Working with Tableau
  * Members will learn about Tableau and how to use it in order to make great visualizations.
* Week 5 - 9: Working on The Final Tableau Product
  * Members will focus on creating their own respective visualizations and compile it together to make a cohesive presentation
  * Go nuts on the features! Add some drop down and stuff! Remember that a tableau dashboard is a very marketable product. (You can even show it to your potential employer)
* Week 10: Presentation and Polishing Up
  * Final write-up and presentation.

*TBA
*I will upload a good example of a final write up.
